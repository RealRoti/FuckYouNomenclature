# FuckYouNomenclature
Nomenclature database search tool on your python-supported calculator [ITA&amp;ENG SUPPORTED]

### How to use
Basically, you need a calculator that supports Python scripts. Then:

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Se sei italiano, scarica e utilizza "IT-search.py"

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ If you're english, download and use "EN-search.py"


- upload the script on your calculator
- run code
- write the name of the chemical compound/ion you are searching for **(not cap-sensitive)**
- IMPORTANT: in order to read the entire line found, digit "e" so you'll exit shell.
  
Note: in the chemical dataset used here, there are the principal chemical compounds/ions (about 85) that are tipically asked in high school tests or homeworks. If you teacher uses specific compounds that are not mentioned, feel free to add them manually editing the code.
